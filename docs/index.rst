The Lost Art of being Lost
--------------------------

This repository is a marker that reminds me where I need to go. I am tired of the continuous re-googling for information. Instead of trying to remember the exact search phrase to bring up that helpful article, I want to create an organized space to hold "stuff" I continually search for.

Schedule
---------

1. Morning Prayer
2. Bible Reading
3. Bible Study (M,W,F)
4. Hobbies / Projects
5. Walk / Gym
6. Kathy prayer / devotion / stretch
