Unveil
======

Unveil does not allow me to *unveil* anything. Literally, about 3 hours of digging and trying. Same problem, no solution. Giving up. I might need to get a doctorate in Computer Science before I can change anything. I get the security thinking behind it but it's so frustrating being stuck with what they give you.

Giving and trying to get httpd to work.
